These are the fundamental requirements for a Kanban application. However, you can also consider additional features and customizations based on the specific needs of your target users or industry. Developing such an application in Go (Golang) can be a great choice, as Go is known for its efficiency and performance. Make sure to plan the architecture and database design carefully to accommodate these features and scale as your user base grows.
